# Gomoku (Five in a Row) – AI Game Solver 🎯

## 📌 Project Description

This project is an AI-based game solver for **Gomoku (Five in a Row)**. The goal of the game is for a player to get five of their symbols (X or O) in a row either **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** on a grid-based board.

The AI in this project plays the game using two well-known adversarial search algorithms:
- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (optimized version of Minimax)

There are two game modes implemented:
1. **Human vs AI**: A user plays against the AI using the Minimax algorithm.
2. **AI vs AI**: The Minimax AI plays against the Alpha-Beta Pruning AI.
